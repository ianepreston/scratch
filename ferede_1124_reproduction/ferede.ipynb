    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my replication of the empirical results, tables, and figures produced in a paper by Dr. Ergete Ferede, published by the University of Calgary school of public policy in Volume 11:24, September 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper is here: [https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NRR-Ferede.pdf](https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NRR-Ferede.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this paper to reproduce for two reasons. The first is pragmatic; the data it uses is all publicly available, so I actually can. The second is that it describes a topic of importance in the province of Alberta, where I live.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the details of what the paper sets out to show in the paper itself, but in brief the idea is to show that provincial government spending increases in the year following an increase in non-renewable resource revenue, but it does not decrease accordingly in the year following declines in the same revenue source. This has a ratcheting effect on public finance that is a contributor to the \"royalty rollercoaster\" that is Alberta's public finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections I'll go through the code necessary to extract and transform the data set used in the paper, as well as reproduce its key empirical results. Since most economists don't use python, and they make up a key part of my intended audience for this, I'll be adding comments to my code that explicitly describe what some of the functions and methods I'm calling do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm including all of the code necessary to produce this reproduction, since that's a big part of why I'm doing this exercise, but if you're just interested in seeing how my reproduced results compare to the original paper you can skip all the code blocks. You can find the code for this notebook on [my github](https://github.com/ianepreston/ferede_1124_reproduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "A surprising result of this reproduction is that I've identified a single data point error in the original paper that negates its results. Read on to find out what the error was and the impact it had on the results."

    "There are some interesting differences. Most notable is that on the levels of the deficit series I reject the null hypothesis of a unit root using all three tests at a significance level < 1%. The paper specifically notes that if the deficit is stationary in levels then a Vector Error Correction model can be applied. As the original author's fails to reject the null he implements a Vector AutoRegression model on the first differenced data. In levels the only other series that I find to be stationary is natural resource revenue. ADF on program expenditure would also reject the null at 5% significance, but would fail to reject it using the other two tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the first differenced series, since that's what the paper ultimately ends up using, I also reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for all variables using all tests at a 1% significant *except* program expenditure and deficit using Augmented Dickey Fuller. Those last two tests differ from what's reported in the paper. \n",

Phillips-Perron only uses 1 lag and then Newey-West for a long run variance estimator. I also ran these tests using Akaike IC (AIC) for optimal lags for ADF and DF-GLS, with similar results.\n",

Note that without the data error, program spending is shown to rise in response to an increase *or* decrease in natural resource revenue, but only on the second lag (at least at a statistically significant level. That's completely contrary to the main thesis of the paper. Now, given that I've shown with the corrected data set that budget deficits are stationary in levels, maybe a more appropriate form of analysis would have been to use a VECM as the paper states it would have been, but from this I can say that the data error has led to a significant change in the outcome of the analysis."
