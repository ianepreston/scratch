    "### Samuelson's Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Samuelson used a *second-order linear difference equation* to represent a model of national output based on three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *national output identity* asserting that national output is the sum of consumption plus investments plus government purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Keynesian *consumption function* asserting that consumption at time $t$ is equal to a constant times national output at time $t-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "- An investment *accelerator* asserting that investment at time $t$ equals a constant called the *accelerator coefficient* times the difference in output between periods $t-1$ and $t-2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea that consumption plus investment plus government purchases constitute *aggregate demand*, which automatically calls forth an equal amount of *aggregate supply*\n",
    "\n",
    "(To read about linear difference equations see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_difference_equation) or chapter IX of [Sar87](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/zreferences.html#sargent1987)\n",
    "\n",
    "Samuelson used the model to analyze how particular values of the marginal propensity to consume and the accelerator coefficient might give rise to transient *business cycles* in national output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible dynamic properties include\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smooth convergence to a constant level of output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Damped business cycles that eventually converge to a constant level of output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persistent business cycles that neither dampen nor explode\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we present an extension that adds a random shock to the right side of the national income identity representing random fluctuations in aggregate demand\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification makes national output become governed by a second-order *stochastic linear difference equation* that, with appropriate parameter values, gives rise to recurrent irregular business cycles\n",
