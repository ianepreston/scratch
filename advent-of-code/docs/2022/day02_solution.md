# Day 2: Solution

My part 1 for this was definitely not the cleanest, I ran into trouble by trying to
anticipate what part 2 would be. It ended up being mostly throwaway code since part 2
had a different requirement than I expected. I could have refactored out a couple small
pieces for reuse but it didn't seem worth is. Similarly, I'm sure there's a more elegant
way to map out rock paper scissors plays and responses, but there are only nine combos
and it was definitely faster to hard code them up than figure that out.
