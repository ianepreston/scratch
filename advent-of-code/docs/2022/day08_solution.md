# Day 8: Solution

I kind of fell off the wagon doing these puzzles this year. I fell down a rabbit hole
getting [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
working and stopped doing the puzzles. I set this one up mostly to test my newly built
python devcontainer. And it worked pretty well! There are a few more tweaks I could make,
it's defaulting to tabs instead of spaces, which is no good for python, and it didn't
auto detect my venv. But those are both easy to fix quickly when you first load up.

The puzzle itself was quite straightforward. There are certainly some more elegant ways
to do parts of it, but the solution I came up with was fast enough and I'm happy with it.
