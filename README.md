# Scratchpad

I had a whole bunch of repositories for little one off things or projects that I wanted
to follow along with.

That's starting to feel a bit cluttered, so I'm combining them all into this repository
here. Projects that I need to share with others or that have associated releases will
keep their own repos, but everything else will just end up a subfolder in here.

I merged all the old repositories by using [this gist](https://gist.github.com/x-yuri/9890ab1079cf4357d6f269d073fd9731).
